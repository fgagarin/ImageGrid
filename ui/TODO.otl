[_] 22% Gen 3 current todo
	[_] 45% High priority
		[_] BUG: aligning still sometimes gets off...
		| ...after rotating a number of images
		|
		| happens when:
		| 	- getScreenWidthInImages() < 2
		| 	- looking through images in one direction and back, some get misaligned
		| 		...this is stable behaviour by centerRibbon(...), 
		| 		calling it again will not fix this.
		| 		moving next/prev will fix the issue until it comes back again
		| 	- affected by LOAD_SCREENS and number of images in ribbon
		| 		current figures:
		| 			Ribbon: 18
		| 			Position going forward: 4
		| 			Position going back: 1
		| 			LOAD_SCREENS: 6
		| 	NOTE: changing LOAD_SCREENS moves the affected positions.
		| 	NOTE: had a similar bug where some images still kept their 
		| 			prior sizing after recycling...
		| 			...check if centerRibbon(...) and correctImageProportionsForRotation(...)
		| 			are called in right sequence...
		[_] BUG: changing window size in single image modes messes things up...
		| until we cycle to ribbon mode and back...
		[_] BUG: sometimes duplicate images get loaded...
		| this happens when jumping back and forth on the mid ribbon until
		| the last element shows up and then moving left until the frame
		| around the image disappears...
		| at this point, this will return 2:
		|
		| 	$('[order='+$('.current.image').attr('order')+']').length
		|
		[_] BUG: jumping screen images does not load the adjacent ribbons...
		| positioning is OK but ribbons are not fully visible...
		[_] ASAP: test on Android...
		[_] empty view (no data) usable...
		[_] propper system init (start w.o. any data)
		[_] revise reporting scheme...
		| showStatus(...) should be called uniformly, either at the source 
		| or a specific reporting layer...
		[_] tweak image pre-caching size -- keep as many images cached as possible.
		| might be good to always cache the smaller previews so as to make things
		| look faster...
		[_] single ribbon mode
		| should this have up/down navigation?
		|
		| something like showGidsAsRibbon(gids) would be generic and logical...
		[_] image sorting (reverse/date/name/...)
		[_] add ability to save/load ranges of images and the structures around them
		| e.g.load image 100 to current ribbon -> will load 100 images
		| for current ribbon and all the in between images from other
		| ribbons above and below...
		[_] build cache in background...
		| this must be done while updating IMAGES live...
		[_] 6% mark-based operations
			[_] 33% cropping selection
				[X] marked
				[_] by tag/collection
				[_] by group
			[_] shift up/down
			[_] tag
			[_] group
			| a group should behave as a single image but is 
			| viewable/expandable as a ribbon...
			|
			| should be two types of groups:
			| 	- strict - always as a single image
			| 		like a set of versions, processed and processing 
			| 		versions of the same image.
			| 		(auto-group?)
			| 	- loose - similar images, could be named collections
			| 		viewed individually, but can be accessed either from 
			| 		a list or a member image (primary).
			[_] collection
			| make or add to existing collection
		[_] 50% Undo/Redo
			[X] basic one step (revert to last save)
			[_] push/pop state stack
		[_] 0% grouping / meta-image
			[_] versions w. label image
			| a set of images that is represented by one of the group
			[_] collection
		[_] 75% UI elements
			[X] indicators
			[X] image info
			[X] stub info dialog
			[_] detailed image info
		[_] 0% gesture support
			[_] up/down - shift
			[_] left/right - navigate
		[_] 0% CSS
			[_] cleanup
			[_] split themes and layout
		[_] 0% manual ordering
		[_] 0% tweak loader
			[_] thresholds and frame size
			[_] remove extra and repetitive actions
			[_] caching config
		[X] slideshow mode...
		[X] default STUB image...
		| or a loading animation..
		|
		| ...would be good to make something pixilated so as to look nise 
		| on various magnifications.
		|
		| keep always cached.
		[X] import fav dirs (wo. index)...
		[X] ASAP: load/view un-cached directories...
		[X] ASAP: support relative paths in cache...
		[X] ASAP: account for image rotation with screen proportions while positioning
		| getRelativeVisualPosition(...) gives an odd position when:
		| 	- image is rotated
		| 	- image is screen-proportioned
		[X] NOTE: rotating might still produce alignment errors
		| this is due:
		| 	- most outerWidth/outerHeight being used do not account for margins...
		[X] ASAP: rotate images in the viewer...
		| This is a tad complicated by:
		| 	- marks
		| 	- image elem proportions that can change
		[X] 100% themes
			[X] light
			[X] gray
			[X] dark
		[X] make focus up/down chose a closest independently of direction...
		| navigation should be stable and moving up then down should yield 
		| exactly the same result...
		[X] ASAP: rewrite binSearch!! 
		| linSearch obviously is not usable for large sets of data...
		[X] split saving/loading into files and localStorage
		| DATA
		| 	- stored in localStorage
		| 	- stored in file
		| IMAGES
		| 	- stored only in files (does not change)
