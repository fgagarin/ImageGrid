					| might be nice to add a Ps-like "space-dragging"

					|
					| for tablets might be good to add a small timeout to 
					| both gestures and dragging, small enough for things 
					| to feel natural...
					|
					| another way is to start dragging anyway but if the 
					| eventual action resembles a gesture then exec that.
					| ...this will need careful setup of timeouts and 
					| dynamic disabling/enabling of both drag and gestures
					| e.g. of large zooms dragging takes priority.

Goals:
	main ribbon always consistent
	fast sorting via several simple passes
		binary
		| items are split into two ribbons.
		|
		| this can be done either by mandatorily shifting either up or 
		| down or by restricting shifting to just one direction.
		|
		| this is a bit too restrictive.
		|
		| essentially this is a combination in the ternary approach 
		| below as we can still shift images between levels.
		ternary
		| current ribbon and items are either sifted up, shifted down 
		| relative to it or left on, unshifted.
		|
		| main ribbon consistency is not always obvious, especially on 
		| partially sorted sets. e.g. while sorting part of the set where 
		| should the unsorted part be?
		|
		|			sorted section
		| 			+-------------------+
		|
		| 	  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
		| 	-	oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
		|	>		oooooooooooooooooooooxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx... <
		| 	+		   oooooooooooooooo
		| 			         oooo
		|
		| 			         			 +----------------------------+
		| 			         			 which level should this go to?
		|
		| in the illustration, the ribbon marked by ">" and "<" is where 
		| the sorting started.
		|
		| there is also a question of how do we define the border between
		| sorted and unsorted zones and when? 
		| ...after the sort is done, and when is that?
		|
		| possible ways to go around this:
		| 	before sorting select the working batch
		| 		- adds an extra step
		| 		- restricts later sorting
		| 	restrict promotion over the main ribbon
		| 		+ sorting can be refined later in the same mode
		| 		- prevents the user to select the better images on first pass
		| 	split the sorted and unsorted batches and never mix them
		| 		- restricts later sorting
		| 	main ribbon always shows all the better images (from better levels)
		| 		o needs a way to move whole topologies up/down relative 
		| 		  to the main ribbon...
		| 		  one way to do this is select and shift multiple images
		| 		  will shift the whole pyramid (with all the "worse" images in between)
		| 		- introduces modes: sorting / viewing
		| 		- adds a separate stage -- move the topology to a correct
		| 		  main ribbon position
		|
		| Q: is this system applicable to sorting search results?
		| A: likely yes, but the farther one gets from the main ribbon 
		|    the more the difference can get between adjacent images.
	images are always sortable
	all levels always browsable
	make all the steps except the actual sorting implicit
	| i.e. no jumping through hoops for the human...
	use the same mechanism as used for sorting, for image selection
	| this can be used for tagging, exhibitions, ...etc.
		context
		| a context consists of two things:
		| - image selection (might be a product of another context, search or selection)
		| - a way the levels are interpreted within this context
		|
		| default contexts: 
		| - full view rating context
		|   this incorporates ALL the archive and the levels are interpreted as ratings.
		| - selection rating context
		|   same as full view but only part of the archive is rated
		|   XXX this will need to be merged correctly back into the archive...
		| - selection context
		|   this simply takes one set of images as input and shows a subset as output.
		|
		| contexts are persistent, much like a catalogue.
		|
		| a context can be cloned and re-used.
		|
		| contexts can be used to mark:
		| - shoots
		| - subjects
		| - exhibitions/shows
		| - portfolios
		| - ...
