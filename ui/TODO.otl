Goals:
	main ribbon always consistent
	fast sorting via several simple passes
		binary
		| items are split into two ribbons.
		|
		| this can be done either by mandatorily shifting either up or 
		| down or by restricting shifting to just one direction.
		|
		| this is a bit too restrictive.
		|
		| essentially this is a combination in the ternary approach 
		| below as we can still shift images between levels.
		ternary
		| current ribbon and items are either sifted up, shifted down 
		| relative to it or left on, unshifted.
		|
		| main ribbon consistency is not always obvious, especially on 
		| partially sorted sets. e.g. while sorting part of the set where 
		| should the unsorted part be?
		|
		|			sorted section
		| 			+-------------------+
		|
		| 	  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
		| 	-	oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
		|	>		oooooooooooooooooooooxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx... <
		| 	+		   oooooooooooooooo
		| 			         oooo
		|
		| 			         			 +----------------------------+
		| 			         			 which level should this go to?
		|
		| in the illustration, the ribbon marked by ">" and "<" is where 
		| the sorting started.
		|
		| there is also a question of how do we define the border between
		| sorted and unsorted zones and when? 
		| ...after the sort is done, and when is that?
		|
		| possible ways to go around this:
		| 	before sorting select the working batch
		| 		- adds an extra step
		| 		- restricts later sorting
		| 	restrict promotion over the main ribbon
		| 		+ sorting can be refined later in the same mode
		| 		- prevents the user to select the better images on first pass
		| 	split the sorted and unsorted batches and never mix them
		| 		- restricts later sorting
		| 	main ribbon always shows all the better images (from better levels)
		| 		o needs a way to move whole topologies up/down relative 
		| 		  to the main ribbon...
		| 		  one way to do this is select and shift multiple images
		| 		  will shift the whole pyramid (with all the "worse" images in between)
		| 		- introduces modes: sorting / viewing
		| 		- adds a separate stage -- move the topology to a correct
		| 		  main ribbon position
		|
		| Q: is this system applicable to sorting search results?
		| A: likely yes, but the farther one gets from the main ribbon 
		|    the more the difference can get between adjacent images.
	images are always sortable
	all levels always browsable
	make all the steps except the actual sorting implicit
	| i.e. no jumping through hoops for the human...
