		[_] BUG: aligning still sometimes gets off...
		| ...after rotating a number of images
		[_] ASAP: support relative paths in cache...
		[_] ASAP: load/view un-cached directories...
		[_] import fav dirs (wo. index)...
		[_] add ability to save/load ranges of images and the structures around them
		| e.g.load image 100 to current ribbon -> will load 100 images
		| for current ribbon and all the in between images from other
		| ribbons above and below...
		[_] BUG: sometimes duplicate images get loaded...
		| this happens when jumping back and forth on the mid ribbon until
		| the last element shows up and then moving left until the frame
		| around the image disappears...
		| at this point, this will return 2:
		|
		| 	$('[order='+$('.current.image').attr('order')+']').length
		|
		[_] BUG: jumping screen images does not load the adjacent ribbons...
		| positioning is OK but ribbons are not fully visible...

			[_] group
			| a group should behave as a single image but is 
			| viewable/expandable as a ribbon...
			|
			| should be two types of groups:
			| 	- strict - always as a single image
			| 		like a set of versions, processed and processing 
			| 		versions of the same image.
			| 		(auto-group?)
			| 	- loose - similar images, could be named collections
			| 		viewed individually, but can be accessed either from 
			| 		a list or a member image (primary).

		[X] ASAP: account for image rotation with screen proportions while positioning
		| getRelativeVisualPosition(...) gives an odd position when:
		| 	- image is rotated
		| 	- image is screen-proportioned
		[X] NOTE: rotating might still produce alignment errors
		| this is due:
		| 	- most outerWidth/outerHeight being used do not account for margins...
		[X] ASAP: rotate images in the viewer...
		| This is a tad complicated by:
		| 	- marks
		| 	- image elem proportions that can change

		[X] split saving/loading into files and localStorage
