
Modules and RequireJS
=====================

Most of the system is loaded via browser context RequireJS loader, in 
node/nw context node-specific stuff is loaded with a second node-enabled
RequireJS instance or node require.

This is done to:
	- Minimize the difference between pure browser, nw and node 
	  versions
	- Enable devtools introspection on most modules.
	  NOTE: his is mostly due to the inability to view the node 
	 	context in nw.js devtools, when this is resolved this
		point should be revised.


Different loaders:
------------------

There are two RequireJS instances present in most contexts in nw.js 
within the define(..) runner:
	- require(..)		
		Pure browser RequireJS instance, used to load local 
		modules.

	- requirejs(..)		
		Node-enabled RequireJS instance, used to load node 
		modules.
		This is needed as the above require(..) overloads the 
		node native loader.

The future:
-----------

This seems a bit confusing, so at least the naming convention should be
revised.
